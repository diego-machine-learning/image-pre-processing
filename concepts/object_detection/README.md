Collection of study resources aiming to help on performing efficient shape detection over images.

* reduce image noising ( grayscale | blurring )
* identify edges in image ( canny )
* find countours in image ( edged image )
* find the distance between two points on a curve ( arcLength )
* determine the shapes approximation ( approxPolyDP )

Failback

### if some parts of shapes are missing

* based on previous step, apply a threeshold to define potential points for boundaries restoration ( custom )
* find the distance between two points ( euclidean )
*
